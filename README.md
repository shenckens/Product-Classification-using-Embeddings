# Product-Classification-using-Embeddings

The main task is completed in the task.py file, where the best matching category is 'predicted' using sentence embedding and cosine similarity.
Since the results could be improved when using a NN that captures context from sequential data, the task is also redone using a long-term short memory model in task_lstm.py. 

To run the code, please make sure to first install the required packages.

I am happy to go through the code together soon and discuss the decisions, pitfalls and future improvements together.
